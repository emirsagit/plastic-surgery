## Requirements

- First of all, I created this project for a doctor, MD. Requirements are:
- A good desing.
- A simple solution for online appointment.
- Seo optimized, fast website
- An image gallery
- A simple CMS where site owner can do CRUD operations.

## Process and What I learned

- After thinking about the design spec, I focused on getting all the essentials working, like the backend, database design, routing, multilanguage implementation, and parsing the data. From there, I worked on file structure to make the blade components reusable and easier to maintain. And finally, there were several rounds of component coding, styling, and refactoring.
- It's the first project I used alpine. I think Alpine is a good option that is lightweight and also easing JavaScript implementation. 
- Customer wanted three embedded youtube videos on his home page. First, I directly embed youtube videos. But it killed webpage speed. After that, I tried lazy loading javascript packages for videos.  Because the videos are too close to the top of the page, It didn't work. Then I created a popup page for youtube videos for dynamically load videos after clicking a thumbnail with JS. I think It's the best solution other than a CDN option.
- Creating an accordion is very easy with using Alpine and Tailwind.  
- I learned how to implement CK editor and style its content.
- I like this project. The next thing I'll focus on is Jamstack.
