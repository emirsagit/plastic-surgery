    "istanbulBurunEstetigi" => "<p class='pb-2'>Our nose is located in the very center of our face, which is the source of our beauty. Therefore, it has a huge impact on our external appearance. Our nose structure may not be proportional to our face due to genetic reasons or effects such as falls and trauma. First of all, I would like to point out that you are not the first person whose nose structure is not compatible with the face. I can even say that you are among the majority who are not satisfied with the shape of the nose :) However, this can affect our life, our self-confidence and our self-respect. Moreover, we may experience breathing problems. Our nose may be the source of problems that reduce our quality of life, such as snoring and waking up tired.</p>

Factors such as genetics, birth defects, aging, sunspots, trauma, accidents can cause facial abnormalities.

Today, advances in facial aesthetic surgery have facilitated the solution of the problems we experience with our faces.</p>

There is more than one treatment method for each of the above-mentioned aesthetic problems. The important thing is to determine the most appropriate solution that can give the desired result for the patient. If the aesthetic problem is caused by more than one reason, all problems can be resolved by a single surgical intervention. For example, lip lifting can be applied together with rhinoplasty in the same session. So the harmony of the lips and nose can get.</p>
